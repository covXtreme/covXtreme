# covXtreme Project Governance

covXtreme is a project of the [Linux Foundation (LF) Energy](https://lfenergy.org/). The covXtreme project maintains a Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which has final authority over the project. As defined in the project charter, TSC responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

*Discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to covXtreme that affect multiple projects.
*Maintenance and administration of the covXtreme GitHub repository.
*Co-ordinating technical direction of the project.
*Co-ordinatng marketing, events, and communications regarding covXtreme.

## Maintainers

There are also a set of maintainers of the project that will regularly make improvements to the code. If any queries arise, the first point contact should always be individuals that sit on the TSC and not the maintainers. 

## TSC Nomination and Succession
Any proposal for additional members of the TSC may be submitted by reaching out to a current TSC member or raising the issue at a TSC meeting. New TSC members are accepted or rejected by majority vote of the TSC.

If a TSC member is for an extended period not regularly participating or performing the responsibilities expected of TSC members, the TSC may by majority vote request an alternate TSC member be submitted by that organization, or remove the inactive member from the TSC.

A member of the TSC may nominate a successor in the event that such member decides to leave the TSC, and the TSC shall confirm or reject such nomination by a vote. In the event that the departing member's nomination for successor is rejected by vote of the TSC, the departing member shall be entitled to continue nominating successors until one such successor is confirmed by vote of the TSC. If the departing member fails or is unable to nominate a successor, the TSC may nominate one on the departing member's behalf.

Voting TSC membership is presumed to be retained by the individual even if they change employers. The TSC may take action to ensure that organizational stakeholder representation not become severely disproportionate, for example by urging an organization that loses its sole TSC representative to nominate a new member, or to limit the total number of members from any one organization if too many members all move to the same organization.

## TSC Meetings

All meetings of the TSC are intended to be open to the public, except where there is a reasonable need for privacy. The TSC meets regularly in a video conference call, at a cadence deemed appropriate by the TSC. The TSC Chair moderates the meeting, or appoints another TSC member to moderate in his or her absence. Scheduling and connection details may be found in the public [LF Energy Calendar](https://wiki.lfenergy.org/display/HOME/Community+Calendar).

Prior to each TSC meeting, the meeting chair will share the agenda with the TSC members and broader community.
