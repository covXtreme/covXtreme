# Order of doing stuff

PHIL
- Aarthi
- Write paper

EMMA
- Get code running on laptop and VM (via Git, on branch: ImproveContours)
- Get simulation running (not in anger, just that you know it will work when F5ed)
- Make small code changes
- Run simulation with "stable code"
- Pick nice fancy second study (trivariate response, 2D covariate)
- User guide

# Code

DONE: Tidy up contours (Phil things this is OK now)
- Improved algorithms (very minor)
- Promoting fiddle factors to user input (done this for contours already)

Standard headers throughout

Make figures more presentable 
- Contour stuff looks ok (probably)
- Some of the other figures have overlapping text (just needs a bit more "quality")

# Simulation study

EMMA: Need to re-run the simulation study with the newest code, to check it's stable

# User guide

EMMA: Ensure consistency between user guide and code
- "interior hull" to remove Huseby bow-ties
- extra contour fiddle factors now available as user options

nGrd=100; %Number of GRiD locations in each of x and y when x-y domain needs discretisation\
nPnt=200; %1 x 1, how many points from which to draw contour\
SmtWdtC=5; %SMooThing WiDTh for the huseby contour C function\
nSml=1e6; %Number of SiMuLations

EMMA: Does the user guide give sufficient detail on the *new* algorithms used?
- importance sampling

# Paper

There will be 2 case studies
- Case study 1 (this is decided)
- Case study 2 (trivariate response, 2D covariate)

# GitHub

PHIL: Aarthi is the person to organise locating the code on "externel Shell" GitHub
- Need to send her a one-page description
