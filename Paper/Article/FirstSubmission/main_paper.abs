The PPC software provides functionality for estimation of marginal and conditional extreme value models, non-stationary with respect to covariates, and environmental design contours. Generalised Pareto (GP) marginal models of peaks over threshold are estimated, using a piecewise-constant representation for the variation of GP threshold and scale parameters on the (potentially multidimensional) covariate domain of interest.
    The conditional variation of one or more associated variates, given a large value of a single conditioning variate, is described using the conditional extremes model of Heffernan and Tawn (2004, HT), the slope term of which is also assumed to vary in a piecewise constant manner with covariates. Optimal smoothness of marginal and conditional extreme value model parameters with respect to covariates is estimated using cross-validated roughness-penalised maximum likelihood estimation. Uncertainties in model parameter estimates due to marginal and conditional extreme value threshold choice, and sample size, are quantified using a bootstrap resampling scheme. Estimates of environmental contours using various schemes, including the direct sampling approach of Huseby et al. 2013, are calculated by simulation or numerical integration under fitted models. The software was developed for metocean applications, but is applicable generally to multivariate samples of peaks over threshold.
