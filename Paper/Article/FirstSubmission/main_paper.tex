\begin{abstract}
    The PPC software provides functionality for estimation of marginal and conditional extreme value models, non-stationary with respect to covariates, and environmental design contours. Generalised Pareto (GP) marginal models of peaks over threshold are estimated, using a piecewise-constant representation for the variation of GP threshold and scale parameters on the (potentially multidimensional) covariate domain of interest. 
    The conditional variation of one or more associated variates, given a large value of a single conditioning variate, is described using the conditional extremes model of Heffernan and Tawn (2004, HT), the slope term of which is also assumed to vary in a piecewise constant manner with covariates. Optimal smoothness of marginal and conditional extreme value model parameters with respect to covariates is estimated using cross-validated roughness-penalised maximum likelihood estimation. Uncertainties in model parameter estimates due to marginal and conditional extreme value threshold choice, and sample size, are quantified using a bootstrap resampling scheme. Estimates of environmental contours using various schemes, including the direct sampling approach of Huseby et al. 2013, are calculated by simulation or numerical integration under fitted models. The software was developed for metocean applications, but is applicable generally to multivariate samples of peaks over threshold.

\section*{OUTSTANDING ACTIONS}

\subsection*{Ross}
\par Header comments: need to be standardised across all MATLAB; a mess at present, but easy to improve
\par User guide: This is in really good state, so we just need to check it's up to date. What's not up to date? Ross/David, what have you modified or added? You said changes are all to HT module. So we need to check whether the userguide is correct or not. My (probably incomplete) list to be checked is
\begin{itemize}
	\item DL residuals
	\item  Backfitting for parameter estimation
	\item  Improved diagnostics 
	\item  Importance sampling in place of/along side MC simulation
\end{itemize}
\par Are there any Shell hoops we need to jump through?
\par Where should this be hosted from?
\par Create new repo

\subsection*{Emma}

\par Act as dumb user, go through process following guide / spot any things to improve

\par Update userguide with new bit in HT

\par Mention the weird seasons option (used by Erik V for ship motions)

\par ***Articles using PPC: \cite{BorEA19} suggest that the algorithm may be useful for analysis of extreme ocean current profiles with depth. \cite{GurEA21} have used their enhancement of an earlier version of the algorithm for analysis of electrical signals in the human brain. The software has motivated the development of analogous prototype software PPL for marginal extreme value modelling with penalised piecewise-linear covariate representations (\citealt{BrlEA22}). The software has also been used as a pre-processor for transformation of data to standard marginal scale, allowing joint and conditional extreme value analysis (e.g. \citealt{ShtEA20a}; \citealt{ShtEA21}).

\par Need to say that people like Kevin have used the software for consultancy.
